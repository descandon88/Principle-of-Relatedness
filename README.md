# Principle-of-Relatedness and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Some sources of principle of relatedness, SVD and complex systems for economic growth

# Papers
<p>In principle, we say that two activities, such as products, industries, or research areas are related when they require similar knowledge or inputs</p>
 <p>Hidalgo et al. [2] introduced the idea of the product space—a network connecting products that are likely to be exported in tandem—to show that the probability that  a country will start exporting a product increases with the number of related products that this country already exports </p>
