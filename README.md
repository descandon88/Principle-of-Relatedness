<p>In principle, we say that two activities, such as products, industries, or research areas are related when they require similar knowledge or inputs (Fig. 1A)</p>
<p>Hidalgo et al. [2] introduced the idea of the product space—a network connecting
products that are likely to be exported in tandem—to show that the probability that a
country will start exporting a product increases with the number of related products that
this country already exports </p>
